# Awesome-Chocolate-Sales-Analysis

##**🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project for Awesome Chocolate! 🍫**

I've recently completed a comprehensive dashboard that provides key insights into our operations. Here's a quick overview:

🔹 KPI Metrics: Total Sales, Total Boxes, Total Shipment, Total Cost, and Total Profit

🔹 Interactive Elements:

‣ A dynamic line chart that changes the X-axis based on user-selected field parameters.

‣ Slicer visuals for easy filtering by product category and geo region.

‣ A matrix view showcasing the performance of salespeople, including their profit and whether they achieved profit targets.

🔹 User Experience Enhancement:

‣ A toggle button using bookmarks to switch between Sales Person View and Product Sales View, providing a seamless and intuitive experience.

‣ This dashboard is designed to provide a holistic view of our business metrics, enabling data-driven decisions. Looking forward to feedback and continuous improvements!
