**üöÄ Excited to Share My Latest Project for Awesome Chocolate! üç´**

**I've recently completed a comprehensive dashboard that provides key insights into our operations. Here's a quick overview:**

üîπ KPI Metrics: Total Sales, Total Boxes, Total Shipment, Total Cost, and Total Profit

**Interactive Elements:**

‚Ä£ A dynamic line chart that changes the X-axis based on user-selected field parameters.

‚Ä£ Slicer visuals for easy filtering by product category and geo region.

‚Ä£ A matrix view showcasing the performance of salespeople, including their profit and whether they achieved profit targets.

**üîπ User Experience Enhancement:**

‚Ä£ A toggle button using bookmarks to switch between Sales Person View and Product Sales View, providing a seamless and intuitive experience.

‚Ä£ This dashboard is designed to provide a holistic view of our business metrics, enabling data-driven decisions. Looking forward to feedback and continuous improvements!
